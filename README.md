### Python Algorithm Design

Just a simple repo containing one module. The module consists of several functions and
one interface that solve algorithm based problems. The problems I've found from various sources 
but I've written their solutions myself. Feel free to correct them or see if you can find a more 
efficient solution. Some of them contain their respective complexities in their doc strings. See if
you can improve on them.
