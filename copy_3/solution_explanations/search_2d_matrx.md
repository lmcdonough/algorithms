# Summary

This code provides a solution to search for a target value in a matrix using binary search.

## Example Usage

```python
# Create an instance of the Solution class
solution = Solution()

# Define a matrix
matrix = [
    [1, 3, 5, 7],
    [10, 11, 16, 20],
    [23, 30, 34, 60]
]

# Define the target value
target = 16

# Call the searchMatrix method to search for the target value in the matrix
result = solution.searchMatrix(matrix, target)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: True
```

## Code Analysis

### Main functionalities

- The code above is a Python implementation of a function to search for a target value in a 2D matrix.
- The function takes a matrix of integers and a target integer as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the target value is present in the matrix.
- The implementation uses a binary search algorithm to search for the target value in the matrix.
- The function first initializes the variables m and n to the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
- It then initializes the variables left and right to the first and last indices of the matrix, respectively, converted to a 1D index. This allows the function to treat the matrix as a 1D array for the purposes of binary search.
- The function then enters a while loop that continues until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer.
- In each iteration of the loop, the function calculates the middle index of the search interval using integer division and the modulo operator.
- It then retrieves the value at the middle index of the matrix using the 2D index conversion formula mid // n and mid % n.
- If the middle value is equal to the target value, the function returns True to indicate that the target value is present in the matrix.
- If the middle value is less than the target value, the function moves the left pointer to the right of the middle index to search the right half of the matrix.
- If the middle value is greater than the target value, the function moves the right pointer to the left of the middle index to search the left half of the matrix.
- The function continues to loop until the target value is found or the left pointer becomes greater than the right pointer, at which point the function returns False to indicate that the target value was not found in the matrix.
- Overall, this implementation of the binary search algorithm for a 2D matrix is efficient and effective, with a time complexity of O(log(mn)) and a space complexity of O(1), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
- However, it assumes that the input matrix is sorted in non-descending order, and may not work correctly if the matrix is not sorted or if the target value is not present in the matrix.
- Additionally, it may not be the most appropriate algorithm for very large matrices, as the overhead of the binary search may outweigh the benefits of the reduced search time.

- The class called `Solution` that provides a solution to search for a target value in a 2D matrix using binary search. The class defines a single method called `searchMatrix` that takes a matrix of integers and a target integer as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the target value is present in the matrix. The implementation uses a binary search algorithm to search for the target value in the matrix.

- The `searchMatrix` method first gets the number of rows and columns in the matrix by calling the `len` function on the matrix and its first row, respectively.
- It then initializes the variables `left` and `right` to the first and last indices of the matrix, respectively, converted to a 1D index. This allows the method to treat the matrix as a 1D array for the purposes of binary search.
- The method then enters a while loop that continues until the `left` pointer is greater than the `right` pointer.
- In each iteration of the loop, the method calculates the middle index of the search interval using integer division and the modulo operator.
- It then retrieves the value at the middle index of the matrix using the 2D index conversion formula `mid // n` and `mid % n`.
- The method also includes a fix for an empty matrix by setting the middle value to 0 if the number of columns is 0.
- If the middle value is equal to the target value, the method returns `True` to indicate that the target value is present in the matrix.
- If the middle value is less than the target value, the method moves the `left` pointer to the right of the middle index to search the right half of the matrix.
- If the middle value is greater than the target value, the method moves the `right` pointer to the left of the middle index to search the left half of the matrix.
- The method continues to loop until the target value is found or the `left` pointer becomes greater than the `right` pointer, at which point the method returns `False` to indicate that the target value was not found in the matrix.
- Overall, this implementation of the binary search algorithm for a 2D matrix is efficient and effective, with a time complexity of O(log(mn)) and a space complexity of O(1), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
- However, it assumes that the input matrix is sorted in non-descending order, and may not work correctly if the matrix is not sorted or if the target value is not present in the matrix.
- Additionally, the implementation is part of a class, which may not be necessary for simple use cases.
