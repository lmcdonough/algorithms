# Invert Binary Tree

- The solution is a recursive implementation of a function to invert a binary tree. The function takes a root node as input, and returns the root node of the inverted tree.

- The implementation works by recursively swapping the left and right child nodes of each node in the tree. Specifically, the function first checks if the root node is `None` (i.e. the tree is empty), and if so, returns `None`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the right and left child nodes of the root node, and then swaps the left and right child nodes of the root node.

- The swapping of the left and right child nodes is done using a Pythonic syntax that allows for multiple assignments in a single line. Specifically, the line `root.left, root.right = self.invertTree(root.right), self.invertTree(root.left)` swaps the left and right child nodes of the root node by assigning the value of `root.right` to `root.left`, and the value of `root.left` to `root.right`. The values assigned to `root.left` and `root.right` are obtained by recursively calling the `invertTree` function on the right and left child nodes of the root node, respectively.

- Overall, this implementation of the binary tree inversion function is concise and elegant, and takes advantage of the recursive nature of the problem to simplify the code. However, it may not be the most efficient implementation for very large trees, as it requires a lot of recursive function calls and may lead to stack overflow errors. In such cases, an iterative implementation or a more optimized recursive implementation may be more appropriate.
