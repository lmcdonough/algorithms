# Summary

The `group_anagrams` function takes in a list of strings and groups together the strings that are anagrams of each other.

## Example Usage

```python
strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(group_anagrams(strs))
```

Output:

```python
[["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

## Code Analysis

### Inputs

The function takes in a list of strings (`strs`).
___

### Flow

1. The function initializes an empty dictionary called `anagram_groups` using `collections.defaultdict(list)`. This dictionary will store the anagram groups.
2. It also initializes a list called `letter_count` with 26 zeros. This list will be used to count the frequency of each letter in a word.
3. The function then iterates through each word in the input list.
4. For each word, it resets `letter_count` to all zeros.
5. It then iterates through each letter in the word and increments the corresponding index in `letter_count` based on the letter's position in the alphabet.
6. After counting the letters in the word, it appends the word to the list in `anagram_groups` corresponding to its letter count (converted to a tuple).

7. Finally, the function converts the values of `anagram_groups` to a list and returns it as the output.

___

### Outputs

The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains all the strings that are anagrams of each other.
